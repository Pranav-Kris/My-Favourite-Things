    <h2>Badminton</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I enjoy badminton for its fast-paced action and strategic gameplay. The
      intensity of the rallies and the need for quick reflexes keep me on my
      toes, constantly engaged in the match. Whether I'm unleashing a powerful
      smash or executing a delicate drop shot, every point feels like a small
      victory. Beyond the physical aspect, badminton also challenges me
      mentally, requiring strategic thinking and anticipation to outsmart my
      opponent. Plus, the social aspect of playing with friends adds to the fun,
      making each game an enjoyable experience. Overall, badminton is a sport
      that combines athleticism, strategy, and camaraderie, keeping me hooked
      every time I step onto the court.

    <h2>Chess</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Chess captivates me with its timeless allure and intellectual depth. Every
      move on the board is a calculated decision, requiring strategic foresight
      and tactical ingenuity. The mental challenge of analyzing positions,
      anticipating my opponent's moves, and formulating long-term plans keeps my
      mind sharp and engaged. Each game is a unique journey, filled with
      thrilling moments of triumph and sobering lessons in defeat. Whether I'm
      playing casually with friends or competing in tournaments, the rich
      history and endless possibilities of chess never fail to fascinate me.
      It's not just a game; it's a profound exploration of strategy, creativity,
      and perseverance that continues to inspire and captivate me.

    <h2>Medicine</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I have been deeply motivated to pursue a job in the field of medecin for
      the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Medicine resonates with me on a deeply personal level, blending science,
        compassion, and the drive to make a positive impact on people's lives.
      </li>
      <li>
        The pursuit of medical knowledge is an endless journey, filled with
        discovery, learning, and the constant challenge of staying abreast of
        advancements in the field.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each patient encounter is a unique opportunity to apply that knowledge,
        to listen, to diagnose, and to heal.
      </li>
      <li>
        The profound trust that patients place in their healthcare providers
        fuels my dedication to excellence and drives me to continually strive
        for better outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beyond the technical aspects, medicine allows me to connect with
        individuals on a human level, to empathize with their struggles, and to
        offer support and guidance during their times of need.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's a calling that demands resilience, empathy, and a lifelong
        commitment to serving others, and it's a privilege that I cherish every
        day
      </li>
    </ul>
